all the code i've done for ap computer science a


hey! so i took ap computer science a from 2019-2020, and these are all the assignments i did!
the amount of times i got stuck (because it was the first year our school did this class) was insane,
and i hoped all the time that someone had the code so i could look and see the right way to do it.

so... enjoy! feel free to copy/paste into edhesive or wherever you're turning in your code! :)
